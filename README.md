# PLS-fMRI-application

The goal here is to assess functional connectivity from the multivariate pattern of 2 ROIs. The algorithm we chose is SIMPLS which is most suitable for our research question (described below). These scripts filled the gap of missing SIMPLS algorithm from the existing Python packages. 

Main analyses were done Python. The SIMPLS algorithm was guided by MATLAB plsregress function. The resaerch question was guided and inspired by CANLab repository written in MATLAB.
